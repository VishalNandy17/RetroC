RetroC is a Visual Studio Code extension that generates production-ready Solidity smart contracts and tests in seconds. It provides battle-tested templates (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, DAO, Multisig, Staking, Vesting), smart placeholder prompts, and optional scaffolding for Hardhat/Foundry tests and deployment scripts. RetroC bakes in security best practices via OpenZeppelin, supports configurable settings (license, Solidity version, directories, features), and integrates directly with the VS Code Command Palette for a fast, repeatable Web3 development workflow.
